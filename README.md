# Overview of the Plan my Trip App.

### Purpose

The Beta version of PlanMyTrip is a hit, the following updates are being made to take it to the next level:
 - Increase the random latitudes and longitudes from 1500 to 2000, we will perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap to current weather descriptions for each city
 - Use customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels and plot those hotels on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
 - Create a travel itinerary that shows the route between the four possible cities chosen by the customer and plot the route on a marker layer map with a pop-up        marker for each city in the itinerary.
