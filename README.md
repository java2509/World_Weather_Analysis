# Overview of the Plan my Trip App.

### Purpose

The initial version of PlanMyTrip was a hit, the recommended changes are going to take the App to the next level:
- Increase the random latitudes and longitudes from 1500 to 2000, perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap to current weather descriptions for each city
- Use customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels and plot those destinations and hotels on a marker layer map with    pop-up markers.
- Create a travel itinerary that shows the route between the four possible cities chosen by the customer and plot the journey on a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city in the itinerary.
